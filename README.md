# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (IMDB)

This project applies deep learning techniques to analyze and classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either **positive** or **negative**. The system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and neural network architectures—specifically **RNN**, **LSTM**, and a **hybrid RNN + LSTM** model—for robust sentiment analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Build a sentiment analysis system that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**.
- Compare performance across multiple models:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes (baseline)
  - LSTM-based deep learning model
  - RNN (stacked)
  - A hybrid model combining LSTM and RNN
- Use the **IMDB 50K Movie Review dataset** for training and evaluation.

## 🧠 Models Used

### 1. **Naive Bayes (Baseline)**
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization.
- Fast and interpretable.
- Serves as a performance baseline.

### 2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- Handles long-range dependencies in text.
- Achieved **~89.2% accuracy**.
- Best performance among all models.

### 3. **Stacked RNN**
- Two-layer SimpleRNN architecture.
- Struggles with long-term dependencies.
- Achieved **~70.6% accuracy**.

### 4. **LSTM + RNN Hybrid**
- Combines LSTM's memory with RNN's sequence modeling.
- Good balance of precision and recall.
- Achieved **~86.4% accuracy**.

📚 Key Learnings
LSTM models excel at handling long sequences in text.

RNNs are limited without enhancements like LSTM/GRU.

Combining models can lead to balanced, generalized performance.
